Below is a revised Markdown guide that emphasizes the role of the `--prefix` flag as the target path in your repository where the subtree will reside.

# Git Subtree Guide

This guide covers how to integrate and maintain an external repository using Git subtree. We explain when to use a subtree, detail each command step-by-step, and highlight that the `--prefix` option specifies the directory (path) within your main repository where the subtree will be placed.

## 1. When and Why to Use Git Subtree

- **Integrated Code Base:**  
  Subtrees allow you to store an external project’s code directly within your repository. You avoid the complexity of submodules or separate checkouts.

- **Flexible History Management:**  
  Choose between squashing the imported commits into one concise commit or preserving the full commit history. This decision affects how merge operations and rollbacks are handled.

- **Streamlined Updates:**  
  Pull in updates from the external repository or push your own contributions upstream—all while working from within your main project.

- **Local Changes and Merging:**  
  Even if you make local modifications to the subtree, Git will perform a three‑way merge (based on the subtree’s base commit, your local changes, and the updated remote state) during pulls.

---

## 2. Basic Commands and Workflow

Suppose you wish to integrate an external repository from `https://github.com/example/component.git` into your project under the directory `component`. In every command below, note that **the `--prefix` flag defines the path in your repository where the subtree will be stored.**

### A. Add the External Repository as a Remote

First, add the remote repository so Git knows where to fetch or push code from:

```bash
git remote add component https://github.com/example/component.git
git fetch component main
```

> **Authentication Tip:**  
> If needed, set the remote URL with your authentication token:
> ```bash
> git remote set-url component https://$(cat $TOKEN)@github.com/your-org/component.git
> ```

---

### B. Import the Repository as a Subtree

When you use the `git subtree add` command, the `--prefix` option tells Git where in your repository (which directory) to place the subtree content.

- **With Squashed History (Recommended for a Clean Commit History):**

  ```bash
  git subtree add --prefix=component component main --squash
  ```

  This command imports the `main` branch of the remote into the `component/` directory as a single, squashed commit.

- **Without Squashing (Retain Full History):**

  ```bash
  git subtree add --prefix=component component main
  ```

  Every commit from the remote is integrated into the subtree path specified by `--prefix`.

---

### C. Pull Updates and Handle Local Changes

When the external repository updates, you can merge those changes into your subtree using the same target path defined by `--prefix`.

- **Using Squash:**

  ```bash
  git subtree pull --prefix=component component main --squash
  ```

- **Without Squashing:**

  ```bash
  git subtree pull --prefix=component component main
  ```

**Local Modifications:**  
If you have local changes in the `component/` directory, Git will perform a three‑way merge between:
- The original subtree base,
- Your local changes, and
- The incoming updates from the remote.

For a smoother merge:
- Commit or stash your local changes before pulling.
- Resolve any merge conflicts if they arise, then finish the merge with:
  ```bash
  git add <resolved-files>
  git commit
  ```

---

### D. Push Changes Back to the Remote

To push modifications made within the subtree back to the original external repository, use:

```bash
git subtree push --prefix=component component main
```

The `--prefix=component` ensures that only the changes within the specified directory are considered for the push operation.

---

### E. Splitting Out a Subtree

If you later decide to extract the subtree’s history into its own branch—for example, to convert the subdirectory into its own standalone repository—run:

```bash
git subtree split --prefix=component -b split-component
```

This creates a branch named `split-component` containing the recorded history exclusively for the `component/` directory.

---

## 3. Visual Overview

Below is an ASCII diagram showing how the subtree is integrated using the `--prefix` directory path:

```
               +-------------------------------------+
               | External Repository (Remote)        |
               | https://github.com/example/component |
               +-------------------^-----------------+
                                   |  (Push / Pull Changes)
                                   |
                     +-------------+------------+
                     |    Your Main Repository  |
                     |                        |
                     |   component/           | <-- Defined via --prefix
                     |  (Subtree Contents)    |
                     +-------------+------------+
```

- **`--prefix=component`:** This is where Git integrates the subtree.
- **Pulling and pushing operations:** They target the `component/` directory based on the `--prefix` setting.

## 4. Example Workflow

An end-to-end workflow example:

1. **Add the Remote:**

   ```bash
   git remote add component https://github.com/example/component.git
   git fetch component main
   ```

2. **Add the Subtree with Squashed History:**

   ```bash
   git subtree add --prefix=component component main --squash
   ```

3. **Make Local Changes:**  
   Edit files in the `component/` directory, then commit:

   ```bash
   git add component
   git commit -m "Update component code"
   ```

4. **Pull in Updates (Handling Merges):**

   ```bash
   git subtree pull --prefix=component component main --squash
   ```

5. **Push Local Changes Back:**

   ```bash
   git subtree push --prefix=component component main
   ```

6. **(Optional) Split the Subtree’s History:**

   ```bash
   git subtree split --prefix=component -b split-component
   ```

---

## 5. Tips and Considerations

- **Commit Local Changes First:**  
  Commit or stash any local changes in your subtree directory before pulling updates to simplify merging.

- **Squash vs. Full History:**  
  - Using `--squash` keeps your repository history clean by collapsing multiple commits into one.
  - Omitting `--squash` integrates the complete commit history, which aids in detailed traceability.

- **Consistent Use of `--prefix`:**  
  The `--prefix` option is crucial as it designates the directory within your repository where all subtree operations (add, pull, push, split) are focused. Keep this path consistent to avoid confusion.

- **Coordinating with Upstream Projects:**  
  If the external repository has review processes or CODEOWNERS configurations, ensure any pushed changes comply with those guidelines.

- **Modular Development:**  
  With subtree integration, the external repository remains a modular component of your project. You can update it or split it off into its own repository later if needed.

---

By following this comprehensive guide, you'll not only integrate an external repository into your project, but you'll also understand how each operation specifically targets the subtree via the `--prefix` path. Enjoy a streamlined experience managing integrated histories and bidirectional updates!
