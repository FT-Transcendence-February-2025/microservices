Your architecture is a classic microservices setup: you have multiple backend services—**user_service**, **tournament_service**, **matchmaking_service**, and so on—each handling specific domains, all interacting with their own SQLite databases. Your frontend, built with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS, communicates with these services via API requests.

In this scenario, the question becomes: **What's the best API configuration to tie all these pieces together efficiently, securely, and maintainably?**

Let's dive deep into the possibilities and outline a configuration that suits your architecture best.

  - Each service has its own SQLite database.
  - Services are:
    - **User Service**
    - **Tournament Service**
    - **Matchmaking Service**
    - **Game Session Service**
    - **Notification Service**
    - **Leaderboard Service**

**Characteristics:**

- **Microservices Architecture:** Each service is independent, focusing on a specific functionality.
- **Independent Databases:** Data encapsulation and autonomy for each service.
- **Frontend-Backend Communication:** The frontend needs to communicate with multiple backend endpoints.

---

### **Challenges with the Current Setup**

1. **Complexity in Frontend Requests:**
   - The frontend must know the address and API for each service.
   - Increases coupling between frontend and backend services.

2. **Security Concerns:**
   - Multiple endpoints exposed to the internet.
   - Inconsistent authentication and authorization mechanisms across services.

3. **Scalability and Load Balancing:**
   - Difficult to manage service scaling individually.
   - No centralized way to distribute load or handle traffic spikes.

4. **Cross-Cutting Concerns:**
   - Features like logging, monitoring, rate limiting, and caching need to be implemented in each service separately.

---

### **Recommended API Configuration: Implement an API Gateway**

**Solution:** Introduce an **API Gateway** as a single entry point for all client interactions with your backend services.

---

#### **Benefits of an API Gateway in Your Architecture**

        location /api/users/ {
            proxy_pass http://user_service:3001/;
        }

        # Tournament Service
        location /api/tournaments/ {
            proxy_pass http://tournament_service:3002/;
        }

        # Matchmaking Service
        location /api/matchmaking/ {
            proxy_pass http://matchmaking_service:3003/;
        }

        # Game Session Service
        location /api/game_sessions/ {
            proxy_pass http://game_session_service:3004/;
        }

        # Notification Service
        location /api/notifications/ {
            proxy_pass http://notification_service:3005/;
        }

        # Leaderboard Service
        location /api/leaderboards/ {
            proxy_pass http://leaderboard_service:3006/;
        }

        # Implement security, rate limiting, etc., here
    }
}
```
