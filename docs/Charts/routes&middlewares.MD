Below is an example of how to convert your YAML middleware definitions into Docker labels that Traefik will recognize. When using Traefik with Docker, you can define middlewares directly as labels on your service (or on a dedicated container) so that Traefik creates them automatically. Here’s how to rewrite your YAML block:

### Original YAML Configuration

```yaml
http:
  middlewares:
    rewrite-login:
      replacePathRegex:
        regex: "^/login(.*)"
        replacement: "/api/login$1"
    
    add-allow-header:
      headers:
        customRequestHeaders:
          X-Allow-API: "true"
    
    redirect-to-error:
      redirectRegex:
        regex: ".*"
        replacement: "/error403"
        permanent:
```

*Note:* In your YAML, the value for `permanent` is not specified. It must be either `true` or `false`. For this example, we’ll assume you want a non-permanent redirect (i.e. `false`).

### Rewritten as Docker Labels

You can include the following labels in your Docker Compose file (or as container labels in your Docker configuration):

```yaml
services:
  your-service:
    image: your-image
    labels:
      # Define the rewrite-login middleware
      - "traefik.http.middlewares.rewrite-login.replacePathRegex.regex=^/login(.*)"
      - "traefik.http.middlewares.rewrite-login.replacePathRegex.replacement=/api/login$1"

      # Define the add-allow-header middleware
      - "traefik.http.middlewares.add-allow-header.headers.customRequestHeaders.X-Allow-API=true"

      # Define the redirect-to-error middleware
      - "traefik.http.middlewares.redirect-to-error.redirectRegex.regex=.*"
      - "traefik.http.middlewares.redirect-to-error.redirectRegex.replacement=/error403"
      - "traefik.http.middlewares.redirect-to-error.redirectRegex.permanent=false"
```

### How It Works

- **For `rewrite-login`:**  
  The label  
  `traefik.http.middlewares.rewrite-login.replacePathRegex.regex=^/login(.*)`  
  tells Traefik to match any path beginning with `/login` (capturing the rest of the path, if any), and the label  
  `traefik.http.middlewares.rewrite-login.replacePathRegex.replacement=/api/login$1`  
  rewrites the path to `/api/login` plus any captured suffix.

- **For `add-allow-header`:**  
  The label  
  `traefik.http.middlewares.add-allow-header.headers.customRequestHeaders.X-Allow-API=true`  
  tells Traefik to inject the header `X-Allow-API: true` into the request.

- **For `redirect-to-error`:**  
  The label  
  `traefik.http.middlewares.redirect-to-error.redirectRegex.regex=.*`  
  matches any incoming path, and  
  `traefik.http.middlewares.redirect-to-error.redirectRegex.replacement=/error403`  
  redirects the request to `/error403`. The `permanent=false` flag indicates that this is a temporary redirect.

### Usage Example

Once these middlewares are defined as labels, you can reference them in your router definitions. For example, if you're setting up a router via labels on the same service, you could do:

```yaml
services:
  some-router-service:
    image: your-backend-or-frontend-image
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      # Router for handling login requests through the front end
      - "traefik.http.routers.public-login.rule=Host(`domain`) && Path(`/login`)"
      - "traefik.http.routers.public-login.entrypoints=web"
      - "traefik.http.routers.public-login.middlewares=rewrite-login,add-allow-header"

      # Router for protected API routes (only forwarded when proper header is set)
      - "traefik.http.routers.authorized-api.rule=Host(`domain`) && PathPrefix(`/api`) && Headers(`X-Allow-API`,`true`)"
      - "traefik.http.routers.authorized-api.entrypoints=web"
      - "traefik.http.services.backend-service.loadbalancer.server.port=8080"

      # Router that catches direct API calls and redirects them to /error403
      - "traefik.http.routers.block-api.rule=Host(`domain`) && PathPrefix(`/api`) && !Headers(`X-Allow-API`,`true`)"
      - "traefik.http.routers.block-api.entrypoints=web"
      - "traefik.http.routers.block-api.middlewares=redirect-to-error"
```

### Summary

By rewriting your middleware definitions as Docker labels, you let Traefik automatically build these middlewares from your container labels. This keeps your configuration centralized in your Docker Compose file (or container declaration) and allows for dynamic integration with your other routers and services.

If you have any further questions or need more advanced examples (like combining multiple middlewares or conditional routing), feel free to ask!

When you change from using a single domain (like `domain/api/login`) to using a dedicated subdomain (such as `authentication.domain/api/login`), several things happen:

1. **Host-Based Routing Takes Over:**  
   Instead of relying mainly on URL path rewriting on the same host, Traefik will now match requests based on the host header. For example, you’ll need a router rule like:  
   ```
   Host(`authentication.domain`) && PathPrefix(`/api`)
   ```  
   This means that any request coming to `authentication.domain` will be handled by the router that explicitly expects that host—even if the path is the same.

2. **No (or Different) Path Rewriting Required:**  
   When you were using `domain/api/login`, you might have needed middleware to rewrite a public path (like `/login`) into `/api/login`. With a dedicated subdomain for authentication (i.e. `authentication.domain`), you can expose your API on a cleaner URL without relying on rewriting since the subdomain itself is the clear indicator that the request is going to the authentication service. Of course, you can still combine path rewriting if needed, but it’s not as essential because the host already segregates the authentication endpoint.

3. **DNS and TLS Considerations:**  
   - **DNS Resolution:**  
     Your DNS must be set up so that `authentication.domain` resolves to your Traefik instance.  
   - **TLS Certificate:**  
     Your certificate must cover `authentication.domain` (either individually or via a wildcard), ensuring secure connections.

4. **Host Header Behavior:**  
   Traefik will use the `Host` header from the incoming request to decide which router applies. If a user accesses `authentication.domain/api/login`, Traefik’s routers are matched by the statement `Host(`authentication.domain`)`. This changes the overall configuration – you’ll likely remove or update any middleware that previously handled rewriting of `/login` to `/api/login` because the dedicated subdomain already makes it clear which service to direct the request to.

5. **Separation of Concerns:**  
   Using a dedicated subdomain for authentication increases security and clarity. Your authentication service can be completely separated from other services on the main domain (for instance, your frontend or other APIs), which might simplify both configuration and scaling/security measures (like rate limiting, dedicated authentication middlewares, etc.).

---

### Example: Adjusting a Traefik Router for a Dedicated Subdomain

If you previously had a router for handling login on a public domain, your configuration might have looked like this (using labels or YAML):

```yaml
# Example with a combined setup
- "traefik.http.routers.public-login.rule=Host(`domain`) && Path(`/login`)"
- "traefik.http.routers.public-login.middlewares=rewrite-login,add-allow-header"
```

For a dedicated authentication subdomain, you would change your router rule to something like:

```yaml
# Router for authentication using a dedicated subdomain.
- "traefik.http.routers.auth-api.rule=Host(`authentication.domain`) && PathPrefix(`/api`)"
- "traefik.http.routers.auth-api.entrypoints=websecure"
- "traefik.http.services.backend-service.loadbalancer.server.port=8080"
```

*Key points in this updated configuration:*

- **Host Matching:** The router only triggers when requests come to `authentication.domain`.  
- **Path Condition (Optional):** You can still use `PathPrefix(`/api`)` to further ensure that only requests intended for your API are processed—but you might choose to remove it if the entire subdomain is dedicated to authentication.  
- **EntryPoint:** In production, you’d typically use the secure entry point (often named `websecure`) so that all connections are over HTTPS.

---

### What Happens for a User Submitting a Login Form

1. **User Experience:**  
   The user enters the authentication URL, for example, via a front-end that might redirect them to `https://authentication.domain/login` (or even directly submit to that endpoint).

2. **Routing in Traefik:**  
   Traefik checks the incoming `Host` header. Since the request is for `authentication.domain`, it matches the router with the rule `Host(`authentication.domain`) && ...`.  
   - If you set your router to expect a path like `/api/login`, you might still use a little path rewriting if your public URL is different from your API path, but often the subdomain allows you to simplify the URL entirely.  
   - If the user directly submits to something like `/login` on `authentication.domain`, you might still use a small rewrite middleware to convert `/login` to `/api/login` if your backend expects that structure.

3. **Request Handling:**  
   The router then passes the request to the backend service designated for authentication. With proper DNS and certificate setup for `authentication.domain`, the request flows seamlessly over HTTPS.

---

### In Summary

Switching to a URL like `authentication.domain/api/login` means you’re leveraging host-based routing to better separate concerns. It requires:

- Updating your Traefik router rules to match the subdomain rather than a specific path on a broader domain.
- Ensuring DNS and TLS configurations are in place for `authentication.domain`.
- Possibly simplifying your middleware stack by reducing the need for certain path rewrites (since the subdomain already serves as an indicator of the target service).

These changes can help clarify which parts of your infrastructure handle authentication while potentially increasing security by isolating that functionality into its own dedicated domain.

Below is a high-level approach outlining best practices for managing microservices with a modern API gateway like Traefik, with special attention to routing, security, and maintainability.

---

## 1. Use an API Gateway as the Frontline

**Traefik** is an excellent choice for an API gateway in microservices architecture because it provides:

- **Dynamic Routing & Service Discovery:**  
  Automatically detects services as they spin up (or down) via Docker labels, Kubernetes CRDs, or other providers.

- **Centralized Security & Rewrites:**  
  Uses routers and middlewares to enforce policies (e.g., authentication, path rewriting, rate limiting) across all microservices.

- **SSL/TLS Termination & Load Balancing:**  
  Terminates HTTPS and distributes incoming traffic among service replicas.

---

## 2. Domain-Based and/or Path-Based Segregation

**Domain/Subdomain Routing:**  
- **Dedicated Subdomains:**  
  You can give each microservice or group of related microservices its own subdomain. For example:  
  - `authentication.domain` for the authentication service.  
  - `api.domain` for your business logic services.  
- **Advantages:**  
  Simplifies route matching (using the `Host` rule), reduces the need for complex rewrites, and can ease TLS configuration.

**Path-Based Routing:**  
- Alternatively, group services under a common domain using clear URL prefixes, such as:
  - `domain/api/login` for login endpoints,
  - `domain/api/orders` for orders.
- **Rewrite Middlewares:**  
  If you opt to expose user-friendly endpoints (like `/login`), you can use middlewares to rewrite the paths to their internal equivalents. This decouples the public API design from internal service structure.

---

## 3. Centralize Security with Middleware

For microservices, ensuring that each service is not directly accessible helps enforce your security policy. A common pattern is to:

- **Authenticate Externally:**  
  Have a dedicated authentication microservice that handles login and issues tokens (e.g., JWT).  
  - With Traefik, you can protect direct API access by blocking requests without proper headers.
  
- **Route Protection:**  
  Use Traefik’s middleware to:
  - **Rewrite paths:** Maintain clean public URLs.
  - **Inject security headers:** For instance, add a custom header (e.g., `X-Allow-API: true`) to mark requests that have passed through the proper login flow.
  - **Redirect unauthorized requests:** Rather than exposing your microservices, redirect those requests to an error endpoint or a dedicated error handler.

- **Fine-Grained Access Control:**  
  Consider additional middlewares for:
  - **Rate Limiting:** Prevent abuse.
  - **IP Whitelisting:** Allow only known networks.
  - **Forward Authentication:** Use ForwardAuth to offload authentication to an external service.

---

## 4. Embrace a Dedicated Authentication Service

In a microservices architecture, it’s ideal to have a dedicated authentication service that is isolated from other internal APIs. For example:

- **Subdomain-Based Access:**  
  Use a dedicated subdomain, such as `authentication.domain`, which Traefik routes to the authentication service.
  
- **Benefits:**  
  - **Isolation:** The authentication service is self-contained and can have its own scaling and security policies.
  - **Token-Based Authentication:** Once a user logs in, this service issues a JWT that the API gateway validates on subsequent requests.
  - **Simpler Middleware Configuration:** Once authentication is handled at the edge (via the gateway), internal microservices can assume that incoming requests are trusted.

---

## 5. Combine API Gateway with Service Mesh (When Necessary)

For larger microservices ecosystems, consider employing a **service mesh** (like Istio or Linkerd) alongside Traefik as an external gateway. A service mesh provides:

- **Intra-cluster Communication:**  
  Fine-grained control over how services communicate with one another.
  
- **Advanced Observability & Resilience:**  
  Such as retries, circuit breakers, and distributed tracing.

- **Granular Security:**  
  Mutual TLS (mTLS) between services, which adds an additional layer of security beyond the edge.

---

## 6. Example Scenario: Login Request Flow

Here’s how the pieces come together when a user submits a login form:

1. **User Interaction:**  
   - The user accesses your application (e.g., `https://domain`).  
   - The front‑end (served from, say, `frontend.domain`) displays the login form.

2. **Form Submission:**  
   - The login form’s action is set to a public URL like `/login`.
   - Traefik’s router for `/login` is configured with a rewrite middleware that converts `/login` to `/api/login` (or, if using separate subdomains, it might instead route the request to `authentication.domain/api/login`).

3. **Security Enforcement:**  
   - An additional middleware injects a custom header or validates a token.
   - Traefik’s routers then channel the request:  
     - If the request is properly rewritten and header-marked, it reaches the authentication service.
     - Otherwise, the request is rejected or redirected.

4. **Authentication Service:**  
   - Processes the login request, verifies credentials, and issues a JWT.
   - The token is then used by the front‑end for subsequent API calls.

5. **API Access:**  
   - All subsequent API requests include the JWT, and Traefik—with either a dedicated middleware or a ForwardAuth callback—validates the token before directing traffic to the appropriate microservice.

---

## Conclusion

The best approach for handling microservices with Traefik includes using an API gateway as the central entry point, separating your services either with subdomains or path-based routing, and enforcing security through robust middleware layers. This strategy:

- **Isolates concerns:** Each microservice is deployed independently with its own scaling, deployment, and security requirements.  
- **Simplifies routing and management:** Traefik handles dynamic service discovery, SSL termination, and load balancing.
- **Enhances security:** By centralizing authentication and only allowing verified traffic to reach internal services.

By combining these best practices, you create a robust, maintainable, and secure microservices architecture that scales with your organizational needs.

Would you like to dive deeper into any of these components (for example, JWT-based login flows, advanced middleware for rate limiting, or integrating a service mesh) for your specific environment?


Below is an explanation of how to handle subdomains—specifically for an authentication service using a router with a host rule such as `authentication.domain`—when you have a static configuration for your Traefik entrypoints.

---

## 1. Understanding the Static Configuration

Your current static configuration defines two entrypoints (one for HTTP and one for HTTPS). For example:

```yaml
entryPoints:
  web:
    address: ":80"
    forwardedHeaders:
      trustedIPs:
        - "0.0.0.0/0"
  websecure:
    address: ":443"
    http2:
      maxConcurrentStreams: 250
    http:
      tls:
        # certResolver: myresolver
        domains:
          - main: "{{ env \"DOMAIN\" }}"
            sans:
              - "{{ env \"IP\" }}"
              - "localhost"
              - "127.0.0.1"
    forwardedHeaders:
      trustedIPs:
        - "0.0.0.0/0"
```

A few points to note:

- **TLS Certificates:**  
  The static configuration is set up for TLS on the `websecure` entrypoint. For subdomain support (e.g., `authentication.domain`), your TLS certificate must cover that subdomain either explicitly or via a wildcard.  
  - If your environment variable `DOMAIN` is set to something like `domain.com` and you plan to use `authentication.domain.com`, you’ll need a certificate that includes `authentication.domain.com` (or a wildcard like `*.domain.com`).
  - In your configuration, the `certResolver` is commented out. To automatically obtain certificates (for example, from Let’s Encrypt), you should uncomment this and configure it accordingly.

- **DNS Requirements:**  
  Ensure that the subdomain (e.g., `authentication.domain`) is properly pointed via DNS to your Traefik instance.

---

## 2. Defining a Router for the Subdomain

When you want to expose an authentication service on a subdomain, you’ll typically define a router (using either a dynamic configuration file or Docker labels) that matches the host header.

### Example (Dynamic Configuration)

```yaml
http:
  routers:
    auth-router:
      rule: "Host(`authentication.domain`)"
      entryPoints:
        - websecure
      tls: {}  # This tells Traefik to use TLS for this router.
      service: authentication-service

  services:
    authentication-service:
      loadBalancer:
        servers:
          - url: "http://authentication:8080"
```

### Example (Docker-Compose with Labels)

If you’re using Docker, you can define it via labels on your authentication container:

```yaml
services:
  authentication:
    image: your-authentication-image
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.auth-router.rule=Host(`authentication.domain`)"
      - "traefik.http.routers.auth-router.entrypoints=websecure"
      - "traefik.http.routers.auth-router.tls=true"
      - "traefik.http.services.authentication-service.loadbalancer.server.port=8080"
```

---

## 3. How It Works in Practice

1. **DNS Resolution and TLS:**  
   - A user navigates to `https://authentication.domain`.
   - DNS routes the request to your Traefik instance.
   - During the TLS handshake, Traefik uses the Server Name Indication (SNI) to select the right certificate (provided the certificate covers `authentication.domain`).

2. **Router Matching:**  
   - Traefik examines the incoming request’s host header (`authentication.domain`) and matches it against the router rule defined (`Host(`authentication.domain`)`).
   - Since this router is bound to the `websecure` entrypoint with TLS enabled, it directs the request to the `authentication-service`.

3. **Forwarding to the Service:**  
   - The authentication service (running, for example, on port 8080) receives the request.
   - Your authentication logic processes the request (e.g., handling login, token generation).

4. **Seamless Integration with Other Services:**  
   - Other microservices can be exposed on different subdomains or via path-based routing.
   - By splitting functionality across subdomains (e.g., `authentication.domain` versus `api.domain` or using path prefixes like `/api` on `domain`) you gain better isolation and clarity in your architecture.

---

## 4. Key Considerations

- **Certificate Coverage:**  
  Your TLS certificate must include the subdomain. You can achieve this either by:
  - Using a wildcard certificate (e.g., `*.domain.com` if your domain is `domain.com`).
  - Requesting a certificate that explicitly lists `authentication.domain` as a SAN.
  
- **Matching Routers:**  
  Remember that Traefik’s router rules are based on the `Host` header. If you’ve set your router for `authentication.domain`, any request to that subdomain will be handled by that router.

- **EntryPoints Alignment:**  
  Ensure that the router for your subdomain uses the correct entrypoint (`websecure` in this example) if you require HTTPS.

- **Static vs. Dynamic Configuration:**  
  Your static configuration (entrypoints, TLS, etc.) lays the groundwork. Your dynamic configuration or Docker labels then define how specific requests (by host or path) are routed. They work together to support subdomains seamlessly.

---

## Conclusion

To handle a subdomain like `authentication.domain` with Traefik:
- Update your DNS and certificate configuration so that your certificate covers the subdomain.
- Define a router (dynamic config or Docker labels) that matches on `Host('authentication.domain')`.
- Ensure that this router is bound to the appropriate entrypoint (typically `websecure` for HTTPS).
- Traefik will then automatically route requests destined for `authentication.domain` to your authentication service once the TLS handshake succeeds and the host rule is matched.

By carefully ensuring that your static configuration is aware of subdomain certificates and that your router rules reflect your service architecture, you can cleanly and securely route subdomain traffic within your microservices environment.

Would you like more details or examples regarding certificate management or router-level middleware for further security on subdomains?


Below is a more detailed explanation of two key aspects when handling subdomains with Traefik in a microservices architecture:

1. **Certificate Management** – ensuring your TLS certificates cover your subdomains, and  
2. **Router-Level Middleware for Enhanced Security** – adding extra layers of protection such as IP filtering, basic authentication, or even delegated (forward) authentication.

---

## 1. Certificate Management for Subdomains

### Let's Encrypt via ACME

Traefik supports automatic certificate management with Let's Encrypt. To ensure your subdomain (e.g., `authentication.domain`) is properly secured, your TLS certificate must include that subdomain. Two common approaches are:

- **Wildcard Certificates:**  
  These cover any subdomain. For example, a certificate for `*.domain.com` would work for `authentication.domain.com`, `api.domain.com`, etc.

- **SAN (Subject Alternative Name) Certificates:**  
  Explicitly list your subdomains (e.g., `domain.com`, `authentication.domain`) as alternative names in your certificate.

#### Example Static Configuration with ACME

Below is an example of a simplified Traefik static configuration (in YAML) that includes a certificate resolver:

```yaml
certificatesResolvers:
  myresolver:
    acme:
      email: your-email@example.com
      storage: acme.json
      httpChallenge:
        # Using web for HTTP challenge. Ensure entryPoint "web" is open.
        entryPoint: web

entryPoints:
  web:
    address: ":80"
    forwardedHeaders:
      trustedIPs:
        - "0.0.0.0/0"
  websecure:
    address: ":443"
    http2:
      maxConcurrentStreams: 250
    http:
      tls:
        certResolver: myresolver
        # If you want to enforce a specific certificate (or cover more domains), consider using
        # domains:
        #   - main: "domain.com"
        #     sans:
        #       - "*.domain.com"
    forwardedHeaders:
      trustedIPs:
        - "0.0.0.0/0"
```

**Key Points:**

- **`certResolver: myresolver`** in the `tls` section signals Traefik to use Let's Encrypt (or your ACME provider) to generate certificates.  
- **Wildcard or SAN:**  
  - If your DNS provider supports DNS challenges, you might use that approach to generate a wildcard certificate (e.g., `*.domain.com`), ensuring every subdomain—like `authentication.domain`—is covered.
  - Alternatively, list each domain manually if you know all required subdomains.

### DNS and Environment Considerations

- **DNS:** Make sure that DNS entries for subdomains (e.g., `authentication.domain`) point to your Traefik instance.
- **Environment Variables:** If you’re using environment variables (like `DOMAIN`), ensure that the certificates or your ACME challenge configuration reflect your real domain name(s).

---

## 2. Router-Level Middleware for Enhanced Security

When exposing a service on a dedicated subdomain such as `authentication.domain`, you may want to add extra layers of security. Many common mechanisms include:

- **Basic Authentication:** Protect sensitive endpoints with a username and password.
- **IP Whitelisting:** Restrict access to known, trusted IP ranges.
- **Forward Authentication:** Delegate authentication to an external system, such as an OAuth provider.
- **Custom Headers:** Ensure that only requests with the correct headers (or tokens) can reach the service.

### Example with Traefik Docker Labels

Here’s an example using Docker Compose labels to configure a router on a dedicated authentication subdomain with basic authentication and IP whitelisting.

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  traefik:
    image: traefik:v2.9
    command:
      - "--providers.docker=true"
      - "--providers.docker.exposedbydefault=false"
      - "--entrypoints.web.address=:80"
      - "--entrypoints.websecure.address=:443"
      - "--certificatesResolvers.myresolver.acme.email=your-email@example.com"
      - "--certificatesResolvers.myresolver.acme.storage=acme.json"
      - "--certificatesResolvers.myresolver.acme.httpChallenge.entryPoint=web"
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
    volumes:
      - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro"

  authentication:
    image: your-authentication-image
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      # Router for authentication subdomain
      - "traefik.http.routers.auth-router.rule=Host(`authentication.domain`)"
      - "traefik.http.routers.auth-router.entrypoints=websecure"
      - "traefik.http.routers.auth-router.tls=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.auth-router.tls.certresolver=myresolver"
      
      # Attach security middlewares
      # Basic Authentication middleware
      - "traefik.http.middlewares.auth-basic.basicauth.users=user:$$apr1$$H6uskkkW$$IgXLP6ewTrSuBkTrqE8wj"
      
      # IP Whitelist middleware - allow only a specific IP range (example provided)
      - "traefik.http.middlewares.ip-whitelist.ipwhitelist.sourceRange=192.168.1.0/24,10.0.0.0/16"
      
      # Attach middleware to the router (you can chain them as a comma-separated list)
      - "traefik.http.routers.auth-router.middlewares=auth-basic,ip-whitelist"
      
      # Define the endpoint port for your authentication service container
      - "traefik.http.services.authentication-service.loadbalancer.server.port=8080"
```

**Explanation:**

- **Router Rule:**  
  `traefik.http.routers.auth-router.rule=Host(\`authentication.domain\`)` ensures that only requests targeting `authentication.domain` match this router.
  
- **EntryPoint and TLS:**  
  The router is bound to the `websecure` entry point so that all traffic is encrypted, and it specifies `certresolver=myresolver` so that Let's Encrypt or your ACME provider generates/uses the proper certificate.

- **Basic Authentication Middleware:**  
  The label `traefik.http.middlewares.auth-basic.basicauth.users=...` creates a middleware that enforces basic auth on the authentication service.

- **IP Whitelisting Middleware:**  
  The `ip-whitelist` middleware restricts requests to coming from the specified IP ranges.

- **Chaining Middlewares:**  
  The router uses both `auth-basic` and `ip-whitelist` middlewares in the order they’re defined.

### Additional Middleware Options

- **ForwardAuth Middleware:**  
  If you’d like to delegate authentication to an external provider (e.g., authenticating via OAuth2), configure ForwardAuth by specifying a callback endpoint.  
  Example label:
  
  ```yaml
  - "traefik.http.middlewares.myForwardAuth.forwardauth.address=https://auth-provider.domain/verify"
  - "traefik.http.middlewares.myForwardAuth.forwardauth.trustForwardHeader=true"
  ```

- **Custom Headers & CORS:**  
  You may add headers to enforce security policies or to enable CORS if your authentication service is consumed by various clients.
  
  Example label for header middleware:
  
  ```yaml
  - "traefik.http.middlewares.secure-headers.headers.customResponseHeaders.X-Frame-Options=SAMEORIGIN"
  ```

## Summary

When using a dedicated subdomain such as `authentication.domain`:

1. **Certificate Management:**
   - Use ACME with a certificate resolver (and possibly a wildcard certificate or SAN certificate) so that TLS certificates cover your subdomain.
   - Update your DNS so that `authentication.domain` points to your Traefik instance.

2. **Router-Level Security Enhancements:**
   - Define routers that match the subdomain with a host rule.
   - Bind these routers to a secure entrypoint (e.g., `websecure`).
   - Attach middlewares (basic authentication, IP whitelisting, forward authentication, custom headers) to enforce your security policies.

This approach centralizes and streamlines your routing while securing access to individual microservices based on the subdomain architecture. By combining certificates, domain-based routing, and middleware-driven security, you achieve a robust and scalable microservices architecture.

In a microservices architecture, Traefik acts as a centralized reverse proxy that routes each incoming request to the appropriate microservice based on routing rules (host, path, or other matching criteria). Each microservice operates independently, yet they all share the same gateway. Here’s how the end-to-end flow works when you have multiple microservices:

---

### 1. **Distinct Routers for Each Service**

- **Router Configuration:**  
  Traefik is configured with one or more routers. Every router has rules that determine whether a request should be forwarded to a particular microservice based on aspects like the host header or URL path.  
  - For example, you might have:
    - A router with a rule like `Host(\`authentication.domain\`)` that directs requests for authentication.
    - Another router with a rule like `Host(\`api.domain\`) && PathPrefix(\`/orders\`)` for an orders service.
  
- **Service Definitions:**  
  Each router directs its approved requests to a service definition that specifies the target microservice (and, if needed, a load-balancing configuration).

---

### 2. **Request Flow Through Traefik**

1. **Client Request:**  
   When a client (like your front-end application) sends an HTTP request, it points to a public URL. For instance:
   - A login form might be submitted to `https://domain/login` or directly to a subdomain like `https://authentication.domain/login`.

2. **Routing Decision:**  
   Traefik examines the request’s details (host, path, headers) and matches it against its router rules:
   - If the host is `authentication.domain`, it will match the router for the authentication service.
   - If the request uses a path like `/orders`, it will match the router intended for the orders microservice.

3. **Middleware Transformation (if needed):**  
   Middlewares (such as rewrite or header injection) can be attached to routers. For example, a rewrite middleware might translate `/login` to `/api/login` or a header middleware might attach security credentials. These transformations occur before the request is forwarded.

4. **Forwarding to Microservice:**  
   Once a match is found, Traefik forwards the request to the microservice by invoking its service definition. The microservice could be one of many behind the service name, and Traefik load-balances among available instances.

---

### 3. **Response Flow Back to the Client**

1. **Microservice Processing:**  
   Each microservice processes its incoming request independently. For example:
   - The authentication service verifies login details.
   - The orders service handles order-related requests.

2. **Response Return:**  
   The microservice sends an HTTP response back to Traefik on the same connection that was used to forward the request. This response may include headers, JSON data, or HTML content as appropriate for that service.

3. **Reverse Proxy Behavior:**  
   Traefik, acting as a reverse proxy, simply relays the response back to the client over the originally established secure connection. The client is unaware of the internal routing details or the fact that different services handled the request.
   
4. **Client Receives the Response:**  
   Whether it’s a success message, an error, or a data payload (such as a JWT token from the authentication service), the response arrives back at the front end — completing the round trip.

---

### 4. **How It Works with Different Microservices Together**

- **Seamless Transparency:**  
  Even though your architecture contains many microservices (authentication, orders, inventory, etc.), Traefik’s role is to abstract the complexity. Every request is evaluated independently by its corresponding router, and each service’s response is sent back over its originating connection.
  
- **Stateless Routing:**  
  HTTP is inherently stateless. Traefik does not need to “merge” responses from multiple services for a single request unless you design an aggregator. Each HTTP request/resonse exchange is self-contained.
  
- **Aggregated or Chained Services (Advanced):**  
  If your application architecture ever requires combining data from multiple microservices (for example, merging user info with order history), that logic is typically handled by an API gateway or aggregator service. Traefik routes requests to that aggregator, and that service then calls internal microservices, compiles the results, and returns a unified response to the client.

- **Load Balancing & Resilience:**  
  With multiple instances of each microservice, Traefik distributes requests across them. In case one instance fails, your clients’ requests are transparently routed to another—providing improved reliability.

---

### 5. **Example Scenario**

Imagine a user interacts with your front end which is served from `frontend.domain`:

1. **Login Submission:**  
   - The login form on `frontend.domain` is submitted to `https://authentication.domain/login`.
   - Traefik’s router for `Host(\`authentication.domain\`)` picks up the request.
   - A middleware (if present) rewrites `/login` to `/api/login` or verifies headers.
   - The request is routed to the authentication microservice.
   
2. **Order Request:**  
   - After successful login, the user performs an order operation by sending a request to `https://api.domain/orders/123`.
   - Traefik uses the router with a rule like `Host(\`api.domain\`) && PathPrefix(\`/orders\`)` and sends the request to the orders service.
   
3. **Response Delivery:**  
   - Each microservice processes the request and returns a response.
   - Traefik forwards each response back to the client seamlessly.

---

### Summary

With Traefik as your API gateway, microservices behind it handle different aspects of your application independently. Traefik uses router rules to direct each incoming request to the proper service and then transparently returns the responses back to the client—all over the same secure connection. This creates a scalable and maintainable system where the complexity of multiple services is hidden behind a unified reverse-proxy layer.
