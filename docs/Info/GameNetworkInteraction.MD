 Network Segmentation for Security and Clarity

    Frontend Network: This network is for services that are directly exposed to external traffic. Typically, you’d have your public-facing UI (frontend-service) and possibly other services that handle public connections.

    Backend Network: This network houses internal services (e.g., user-management, authentication) that shouldn’t be directly accessible from the internet. Keeping them isolated reduces exposure and limits lateral movement if a breach ever occurs.

    Traefik as the Bridge: Traefik, as your reverse proxy, must be connected to both networks because it needs to receive public requests (from the frontend network) and then route those requests to the appropriate internal backend services. This “dual-homing” is a common pattern so that only Traefik has visibility into both worlds.

2. Handling Tournament/Game Services

    Option 1: Place Them on the Backend (and Only Expose via Traefik): If the tournament and game services are primarily internal but need selective public exposure (e.g., over secure WebSockets or HTTPS), you can keep them on the backend network. Then, simply configure Traefik with the proper rules (e.g., hostnames or path rules) to expose them. This way, they remain isolated and secure, with Traefik as the sole entry point.

    Option 2: Create a Separate Network for Them: If tournament/game interactions have unique performance, security, or scaling characteristics, you might consider creating a dedicated network (say, a gaming network). In this case, you would connect Traefik to this new network as well as the frontend network. This extra layer of segmentation can offer even more control over traffic flow.

        Pros: Tailored access control, easier monitoring, and potential performance isolation.

        Cons: Increased complexity in network management and routing rules.

In both scenarios, the key is that only Traefik spans multiple networks so that internal services aren’t directly exposed but are accessible through well-defined routes.
3. How to Configure in Docker Compose

    Traefik Service: Ensure Traefik is attached to all networks it needs—e.g., frontend, backend, and possibly gaming—so it can route traffic appropriately.

    Internal Services (User Management, Authentication, Tournament, Game): Attach these only to the network(s) they require. For example:

        User Management & Authentication: Only on backend

        Frontend Service: On frontend

        Tournament & Game: Either remain on backend or join a dedicated gaming network if you choose that path

    Then, add the correct Docker labels so that Traefik’s routers know which network endpoints to target.
