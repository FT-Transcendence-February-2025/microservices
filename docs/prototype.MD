
To handle **WebSockets** between your **frontend** and **backend (match service)** while using **Traefik**, you need to ensure that WebSocket connections are correctly routed and forwarded through your reverse proxy. Hereâ€™s how to properly configure **WebSockets handling in Traefik** and **connect your frontend to the match service**.

---

### **1. WebSockets Basics in Traefik**
WebSockets require proper handling of **Upgrade** and **Connection** headers to ensure persistent connections. Unlike regular HTTP requests, WebSocket connections need to stay open for bidirectional communication.

Since your **match service** is running at:
```
http://localhost:3003/api/game?matchId=
```
And your frontend is expected to request it via:
```
https://domain/api/match/game?matchId=
```
Traefik needs a proper configuration to **route WebSocket traffic**, ensuring that the request upgrade mechanism works correctly.

---

### **2. Updating Traefik Configuration for WebSockets**
Add WebSocket support in your Traefik labels:

```yaml
labels:
  - "traefik.enable=true"
  - "traefik.http.routers.match-service.rule=Host(`${DOMAIN}`) && PathPrefix(`/api/match/game`)"
  - "traefik.http.routers.match-service.entrypoints=websecure"
  - "traefik.http.routers.match-service.tls=true"
  - "traefik.http.routers.match-service.middlewares=match-ws"
  - "traefik.http.services.match-service.loadbalancer.server.port=3003"

  # WebSocket middleware settings
  - "traefik.http.middlewares.match-ws.headers.customrequestheaders.Connection=Upgrade"
  - "traefik.http.middlewares.match-ws.headers.customrequestheaders.Upgrade=websocket"
```

**Key Additions:**
- **Routing:** Defines `/api/match/game` so that Traefik correctly forwards WebSocket traffic.
- **Upgrade Headers:** Ensures WebSockets requests include `Connection=Upgrade` and `Upgrade=websocket`, allowing persistent socket connections.

### **3. Connecting WebSockets from the Frontend**
In your frontend, ensure you correctly initialize the WebSocket connection:

```javascript
const matchId = "example123"; // Replace dynamically
const socket = new WebSocket(`wss://domain/api/match/game?matchId=${matchId}`);

socket.onopen = () => {
    console.log("WebSocket connected!");
};

socket.onmessage = (event) => {
    console.log("Message from server:", event.data);
};

socket.onerror = (error) => {
    console.error("WebSocket Error:", error);
};

socket.onclose = () => {
    console.log("WebSocket closed.");
};
```

**Key Frontend Adjustments:**
- **Use `wss://` for WebSockets over HTTPS.**
- **Ensure the `matchId` is dynamically injected into the WebSocket request URL.**
- **Use proper event listeners (`onopen`, `onmessage`, `onerror`, `onclose`) to handle WebSocket communication.**

### **4. Testing WebSocket Connectivity**
After deploying your **backend**, **Traefik**, and **frontend**, test your WebSocket connection:
```bash
wscat -c wss://domain/api/match/game?matchId=example123
```
If `wscat` is not installed, install it globally:
```bash
npm install -g wscat
```

You should see successful connections if Traefik correctly forwards WebSocket traffic.

---

### **Final Thoughts**
- Traefik requires **custom headers (`Connection=Upgrade` & `Upgrade=websocket`)** for WebSocket connections.
- Ensure the frontend is using `wss://` instead of `https://` for WebSocket connections.
- Use **wscat** or browser tools to debug WebSocket connections.
- If WebSockets fail, check **Traefik logs** and **backend logs** for errors.


When a user connects to a WebSocket, they typically wonâ€™t see the WebSocket URL (`wss://domain/api/match/game?matchId=123`) in their browserâ€™s address bar like they would with standard HTTP requests.

**Why?**  
WebSockets donâ€™t work like traditional web navigationâ€”they are a background communication channel rather than a page URL that gets displayed in the browserâ€™s address bar. The frontend makes the WebSocket connection **inside the code** (e.g., in JavaScript), so the user doesnâ€™t directly navigate to it.

---

### **How Users Can See WebSocket Activity**
Even though they wonâ€™t see the WebSocket connection URL in their address bar, there are ways for them to check WebSocket activity:

1. **Browser Developer Tools**  
   - In **Chrome or Firefox**:  
     - Open DevTools (`F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`).  
     - Go to the **Network** tab.  
     - Filter for **WS** (WebSockets).  
     - You can see the WebSocket request URL and live messages.  

2. **Logging the Connection** (for debugging)  
   If needed, the frontend can **log the WebSocket URL** when a connection is established:
   ```javascript
   const matchId = "123";
   const socketUrl = `wss://domain/api/match/game?matchId=${matchId}`;
   console.log("Connecting to:", socketUrl);
   const socket = new WebSocket(socketUrl);
   ```

3. **Custom UI in the Frontend**  
   If you **want users to be aware of the connection**, you could display the WebSocket status in the UI:
   ```javascript
   document.getElementById("status").innerText = `Connected to: ${socketUrl}`;
   ```
   This way, users can see what backend service they are connected to.

### **How This Works with Traefik**
Even though Traefik routes WebSocket connections through `https://domain/api/match/game`, users will **only see the frontend page URL** (`https://domain/somepage`). The WebSocket connection happens **in the background**, invisible to the user except through DevTools or debug logging.
