Yes, you can handle this with Docker Compose—but not with literal `if ... else ...` blocks in your Dockerfile. Dockerfiles don’t support conditional directives that change the `FROM` instruction on the fly. Instead, you can achieve the desired behavior by using a build argument for the base image and then passing that argument from your Docker Compose file.

Below is how you can set it up:

---

### **1. Modify Your Dockerfile**

Change the conditional base image selection to use a build argument. For example:

```dockerfile
# Declare a build argument for the base image.
ARG BASE_IMAGE=node:20-alpine

# Use the build argument in the FROM instruction.
FROM ${BASE_IMAGE}

WORKDIR /app

# Declare DEBUG_MODE for conditional package installation.
ARG DEBUG_MODE=0

# Conditionally install additional packages if DEBUG_MODE is set.
RUN if [ "$DEBUG_MODE" = "1" ]; then \
      apk update && apk add --no-cache curl openssl jq; \
    fi

COPY src/package*.json ./
RUN npm install --include=dev
COPY src .

# Switch to the vscode user to install extensions.
USER vscode
RUN code --install-extension humao.rest-client \
    && code --install-extension rangav.vscode-thunder-client

# Expose the application port.
EXPOSE 3001

CMD ["npm", "run", "dev"]
```

Here, the Dockerfile uses the `BASE_IMAGE` argument to determine which image to use, thereby replacing the idea of a conditional block with a dynamic value.

---

### **2. Configure Your Docker Compose File**

In your `docker-compose.yml`, pass the appropriate build arguments. For example:

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  app:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
      args:
        BASE_IMAGE: ${BASE_IMAGE:-node:20-alpine}  # Default to node:20-alpine if not provided.
        DEBUG_MODE: ${DEBUG_MODE:-0}               # Default to 0 (false).
    ports:
      - "3001:3001"
```

You can set the `BASE_IMAGE` and `DEBUG_MODE` values either directly in the `docker-compose.yml` file or via an `.env` file in the same directory. For example, an `.env` file might contain:

```env
# Use the vscode dev container image when debugging.
BASE_IMAGE=mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/node:20-alpine
DEBUG_MODE=1
```

When you run `docker-compose build` (or `docker-compose up --build`), Docker Compose will pass those values into the build process.

---

### **Summary**

- **Dockerfile:** Replace the explicit if/else with a build argument in the `FROM` instruction.
- **Docker Compose:** Use the `args` key to pass in the desired base image and other flags like `DEBUG_MODE`.

This setup gives you flexibility over which base image you use for various environments. If you have further questions about integrating multiple configurations or more advanced Docker Compose features, feel free to ask!


The recommended solution is not to install VS Code extensions directly through your Dockerfile but to configure your dev container to install them via your development container configuration. This is because VS Code’s remote development model handles extension installation on the remote (container) side through the **devcontainer.json** file.

However, if you really want to add extension installation steps in your Dockerfile, you’d need to use an image that already includes the VS Code CLI (or code-server) and run commands like `code --install-extension <extension-id>`. Most official alpine-based Node images (such as your `node:20-alpine`) do not include this tooling by default.

Below are two approaches for you to consider:

---

### 1. **Recommended: Use devcontainer.json to Install Extensions**

1. Create (or update) a folder named `.devcontainer` at the root of your project.

2. Inside that folder, create a file named `devcontainer.json` (if you haven’t already). Then list the extensions you want installed by VS Code. For example:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "My Node Dev Container",
     "build": {
       "dockerfile": "Dockerfile",
       "context": "."
     },
     "extensions": [
       "humao.rest-client",           // REST Client extension (for API testing)
       "rangav.vscode-thunder-client"  // Thunder Client alternative
     ],
     "settings": {},
     "remoteUser": "node"
   }
   ```

3. Now, when you use VS Code’s Remote – Containers feature (for example by running the **"Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container"** command), VS Code will build your container using your existing Dockerfile and then install the extensions listed in the `"extensions"` array inside the container’s remote extension host.

---

### 2. **Alternative: Installing Extensions from the Dockerfile**

If you prefer to bake the installation step into your Dockerfile, you must use an image that has the VS Code CLI available. For instance, Microsoft provides dev container images (like `mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/node:20-alpine`) that already include the necessary tools. An example Dockerfile might look like this:

```dockerfile
# Use a dev container base image that supports extension installation.
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/node:20-alpine

WORKDIR /app

ARG DEBUG_MODE

# Conditionally install additional packages if DEBUG_MODE is set.
RUN if [ "$DEBUG_MODE" = "1" ]; then apk update && apk add --no-cache curl openssl jq; fi

COPY src/package*.json ./
RUN npm install --include=dev
COPY src .

# Install the desired VS Code extensions using the code CLI.
# Make sure to run these as the user VS Code expects (typically "vscode")
USER vscode
RUN code --install-extension humao.rest-client \
    && code --install-extension rangav.vscode-thunder-client

# Expose your application port.
EXPOSE 3001

# Return to the default user if needed, or run as "vscode"
CMD ["npm", "run", "dev"]
```

**Important considerations for this approach:**

- **Base Image:**  
  Switching to a dev container image (like `mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/node:20-alpine`) ensures that you have the **code** CLI available. Your original image (`node:20-alpine`) typically does not have this.

- **User Context:**  
  The extension installation command must run as the correct user (usually `vscode`). In the above example, we switch to that user before running the extension install commands.

- **Flexibility:**  
  This approach hard-codes extension installation into your image, which might be less flexible (and require rebuilding the image whenever you change your extension preferences) compared to using the `devcontainer.json` method.

---

### Summary

- **Best Practice:**  
  Use a `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` configuration to list the extensions. This method is straightforward and integrates cleanly with VS Code’s remote development workflow.
  
- **Dockerfile Method:**  
  If you want to install extensions via Dockerfile, use a dev container base image that includes VS Code CLI support (like `mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/node:20-alpine`) and run commands such as `RUN code --install-extension <extension-id>`. Make sure to handle the user context appropriately.

Choose the approach that best fits your workflow. In most cases, using the `devcontainer.json` method is the smoother and more maintainable option when working with VS Code Remote Containers.
