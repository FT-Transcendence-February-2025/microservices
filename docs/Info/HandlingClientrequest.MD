Let's break down the typical flow and responsibilities when a user first connects and how tokens versus static files are handled in a microservices game server architecture.

## 1. **Static Files: Loading the Client Application**

- **Serving Static Content:**  
  When a user visits your site (for example, via a domain routed through Traefik), the browser requests the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image files. These files typically reside in a public folder or on a CDN. In most cases, they are served as public assets without any token requirements because they form the skeleton of your client-side application.

- **Content Delivery:**  
  - **Reverse Proxy or CDN:** Traefik (or another reverse proxy/CDN) serves these files quickly and efficiently.  
  - **Caching:** Static assets are usually cached both on the server side and on the client side, ensuring fast load times.
  - **Security Considerations:**  
    In some advanced cases (for example, if certain static pages are personalized), you might gate them behind an authentication check. However, in most frontend applications, the static content is public so that the web app can load and then decide whether the user is authenticated.

- **Outcome:**  
  The user’s browser loads the client application (index.html, bundled JavaScript, Tailwind CSS-generated styles, images, etc.). At this point, no sensitive state is exchanged—all files are read-only and do not require an active token.

## 2. **Authentication Tokens: Securing API Requests**

- **User Login and Token Issuance:**  
  - **Login Request:** Once the application loads, it typically presents a login or registration form. The user enters their credentials, and the client sends a request to your dedicated Authentication Service.  
  - **Token Generation:** The Authentication Service validates the credentials and, upon success, generates a token (commonly a JSON Web Token or JWT).  
  - **Token Delivery:** This token is sent back to the client and is then stored in a secure location — often in an HTTP-only cookie or in client-side storage (like localStorage/sessionStorage). Using an HTTP-only cookie is more secure against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

- **Using the Token for Subsequent Requests:**  
  - **API Requests:** Every time the client needs to make an API call to another microservice (say, to join a match, update game state, or retrieve profile info), it attaches the token to the request headers (usually as the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header).
  - **Token Verification:** When the API Gateway (or the individual microservice) receives a request, it validates the token using the shared secret or public/private key pair. This process ensures that the request comes from an authenticated user.
  - **Stateless Security:**  
    Because the token is self-contained (carrying the necessary claims and expiration), each microservice can independently verify it without needing to query the central authentication service every time. This stateless approach scales well in a microservices architecture.

- **Session Continuity:**  
  Once a client is authenticated and connected (for example, via WebSockets to a game server instance), the token might be used only at the initial handshake. After that, the established persistent connection carries the state until the user disconnects or the session ends.

## 3. **How They Work Together During a Connection**

Consider this typical flow:

1. **User Access:**
   - The user visits your website (e.g., `https://game.example.com`).
   - Traefik routes the request; static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) are served immediately from the public directory or CDN.  
   - These files load the client application in the browser.

2. **Authentication:**
   - The client displays a login form.  
   - The user enters credentials and the client sends an API request (e.g., `POST /api/login`) with these credentials.  
   - The Authentication Service verifies the credentials and issues a JWT, which gets stored in a secure cookie or local storage.

3. **Authenticated API Communications:**
   - Any subsequent API call or WebSocket upgrade includes the token (usually in the headers or via the secure cookie mechanism).  
   - The backend services (game session, matchmaking, etc.) verify the token and allow the action if it's valid.
   - This ensures every request comes from an authenticated user without sharing in‑memory state across services.

4. **Playing the Game:**
   - The game client, after authentication, might connect to a dedicated game server for real‑time interactions.
   - Static game assets are already loaded, and the token is used only for secure API calls or to validate connection requests to the game instance.

## 4. **Key Takeaways**

- **Static Files:**  
  - Are generally public and loaded without authentication.
  - Delivered via Traefik or a CDN with caching benefits, ensuring fast and efficient distribution of your client app.
  
- **Tokens:**  
  - Are issued upon successful authentication.
  - Secure all subsequent API communications by being attached to every request.
  - Allow for a stateless, scalable way to ensure each microservice in your game server architecture only processes requests from authenticated users.

This separation means your client application can be universally accessible (static files) while ensuring that sensitive operations (game state changes, matchmaking, etc.) are secured by token-based authentication.
